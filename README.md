### 1. **Fork This Repository**

First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account:

- Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right corner of this page.

### 2. **Configure Gitpod to Use Your Forked Dotfiles Repository**

Next, you need to tell Gitpod to use your forked repository as your dotfiles repository.

#### **Step 2.1: Log in to Gitpod**

- Visit [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) and sign in to your account.

#### **Step 2.2: Access Your Account Settings**

- Select **"Settings"** from the dropdown menu.

#### **Step 2.3: Navigate to the "Dotfiles" Section**

- In the left sidebar, click on **"Preferences"** or **"Personalization"**.
- Find the **"Dotfiles"** section.

#### **Step 2.4: Set Your Dotfiles Repository URL**

- Enter the URL of your forked repository:
```bash
https://github.com/yourusername/your-forked-dotfiles-repo.git
```
- Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.
- Replace `your-forked-dotfiles-repo` with the name of your forked repository.

#### **Step 2.5: Save Your Settings**

- Ensure that your changes are saved.

### 3. **Start a New Gitpod Workspace**

Now, you can start a new Gitpod workspace to test the configuration.

#### **Step 3.1: Open a Repository in Gitpod**

- Navigate to any GitHub or GitLab repository that you want to work on.
- Prefix the repository URL with `gitpod.io/#`.

## üõ† How It Works

### install.sh Script:

- The `install.sh` script in this repository is executed by Gitpod during workspace initialization.
- It installs Oh My Posh, downloads the themes, and configures the prompt for both Bash and Zsh.

### Shell Configuration:

- The script adds the necessary initialization commands to your `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc` files.
- It ensures that `~/.local/bin` is added to your `PATH`.
